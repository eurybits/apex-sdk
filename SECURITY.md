# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Apex SDK team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them via email to **security@apexsdk.dev**.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported releases
4. Release new security fix versions as soon as possible
